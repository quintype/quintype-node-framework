The Quintype framework handles most of the heavy lifting in the application for you.

It handles a number of functionality, such as
* The isomorphic rendering
* Automatically forwarding things like amp pages upstream
* Following redirects that are set up in the editor

For an explanation of the architecture of this library, please see [Malibu Documentation](https://developers.quintype.com/malibu/isomorphic-rendering).

This documentation is still WIP. However, many topics might be covered in the [Malibu Documentation](https://developers.quintype.com/malibu) and [tutorial](https://developers.quintype.com/malibu/tutorial)
